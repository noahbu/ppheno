# Plant Phenotyping for Musk Melon Plants

This project focuses on the phenotyping of musk melon plants using dense point clouds generated with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), followed by post-processing to extract meaningful phenotypic data.

## üå± Project Overview

Accurate phenotyping is crucial for understanding plant characteristics and improving crop yields. This project leverages NeRFs to create detailed 3D representations of musk melon plants, enabling comprehensive analysis of their physical traits such as volume, surface area, and other morphological features.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

- `.vscode/`: Configuration files for Visual Studio Code to ensure a consistent development environment.
- `clean_pointcloud/`: Contains scripts and tools for processing and cleaning the raw point cloud data obtained from NeRFs.
- `scripts/`: Includes various utility scripts to facilitate data preprocessing, analysis, and conversions.
- `src/`: Core source code for the project, including:
  - NeRF implementation for generating point clouds.
  - Analysis modules for extracting plant phenotypes.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup guide (this file).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/noahbu/ppheno.git
   cd ppheno
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### 1. Generate Point Clouds using NeRF

- Use NeRF scripts in `src/` to generate dense 3D point clouds of melon plants from image data.

### 2. Clean the Point Clouds

- Navigate to `clean_pointcloud/`:
  ```bash
  python clean.py --input <path_to_raw_pointcloud> --output <path_to_cleaned_output>
  ```

### 3. Run Phenotypic Analysis

- Use the tools in `src/` to extract relevant phenotypic information:
  ```bash
  python analyze.py --input <cleaned_pointcloud>
  ```

### 4. Utility Scripts

- Use `scripts/` for various helper tasks such as format conversion, batch processing, etc.

## üìÅ Data

The dataset used for this project includes multi-angle images of musk melon plants captured in controlled environments. Point clouds are reconstructed using NeRFs.

The NeRF reconstruction requires preprocessing of the video which was done with COLMAP, which needs to be installed for processing.

*Note: Data files are not included in the repository due to size. Contact me for access.*
